# `regular` - Definitions and Theorems about Regular Epressions, Automata and Sets in Lean
The repository will aim to 
- [x] define Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)
- [x] define Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
- [x] define regular expresions (regex)
- [ ] define regular sets
- [ ] prove DFA's, NFA's and regex all are equivalent to regular sets
- [ ] write a fast regex checking algorithm using NFA's and verify it is correct
- [ ] prove the pumping lemma for regular sets
- [ ] write an algorithm for processing a POSIX basic regular exprssion
